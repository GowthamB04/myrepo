# Health Insurance Claim Management System

## Project Overview

The Health Insurance Claim Management System follows a reimbursement-based health insurance claim workflow.

Policyholders receive treatment outside the system, pay hospital expenses personally, and collect supporting documents. They then submit a reimbursement claim with treatment and provider details. Approvers verify treatment data and document uploads, and approved claims move on to reimbursement payment processing. Once payment is complete, the claim status becomes `SETTLED`.

### Key Features

- **Reimbursement Claim Workflow**: Submit claims using direct treatment details instead of requiring pre-created treatment records
- **User Management**: Create and manage users with role-based access
- **Policy Management**: Manage insurance policies and assign them to users
- **Claim Management**: File claims, track statuses, and view decisions
- **Approval Workflow**: Approvers verify treatment, hospital, doctor, and document details
- **Payment Processing**: Process reimbursement payments for approved claims
- **Document Management**: Upload and manage medical reports, bills, receipts, and prescriptions
- **Hospital & Doctor Management**: Manage healthcare providers for administration, reporting, and future expansion
- **Intelligent Claim Recommendation**: Advisory score/status/reason generated for each claim
- **Admin Analytics Dashboard**: Overview, top hospitals/doctors, high-risk users, treatment statistics, and recommendation analytics
- **Endpoint Documentation**: `zee/` folder includes request/response examples for Postman

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java 17
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 4.0.6
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **ORM**: Jakarta Persistence (JPA/Hibernate)
- **Security**: Spring Security with database-backed role authorization
- **Password Encoding**: BCrypt
- **API Format**: REST API with JSON responses
- **Authentication**: Simple username/password with BCrypt hashing

## Database Schema

The system uses 9 main tables:

1. **users**: User accounts with roles (ADMIN, APPROVER, POLICYHOLDER)
2. **insurance_policies**: Insurance policy information
3. **user_policies**: Join table linking users to policies
4. **hospitals**: Hospital information
5. **doctors**: Doctor information linked to hospitals
6. **treatments**: Treatment records linked to users, doctors, and hospitals
7. **Claims:** Insurance claims linked to users, treatments, policies, and recommendation guidance
8. **documents**: Supporting documents uploaded for claims
9. **payments**: Payment records for approved claims

## Role Responsibilities

### ADMIN
- Manage users
- Manage insurance policies
- Manage hospitals
- Manage doctors
- Process payments
- View claims
- Access analytics dashboard

### APPROVER
- View pending claims

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/users/login` - Login user
- Login response returns only `message`, `status`, and `role` fields (no full user object).
- Protected APIs use Spring Security and database-based role authorization.
- CSRF is disabled for easy Postman testing.
- Use HTTP Basic Auth for protected requests with the same database username/password.

### Authorization
- `ADMIN`: manage users, policies, hospitals, doctors, and payments
- `APPROVER`: approve/reject claims and review claims
- `POLICYHOLDER`: raise claims, view own profile, and view own policy status

### REIMBURSEMENT CLAIM WORKFLOW
1. User undergoes treatment.
2. User pays medical expenses.
3. User collects medical reports.
4. User collects prescriptions.
5. User collects bills.
6. User collects payment receipts.
7. User logs into the system.
8. User creates a reimbursement claim.
9. User uploads supporting documents.
10. System calculates recommendation score.
11. Approver reviews claim.
12. Approver approves or rejects.
13. Payment is processed.
14. Claim becomes SETTLED.

### INTELLIGENT CLAIM RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
The system automatically evaluates claims and generates advisory guidance for the approver.

It calculates:
- **Recommendation Score**
- **Recommendation Status**
- **Recommendation Reason**

Possible recommendation status values:
- `APPROVE`
- `REVIEW`
- `REJECT`

Important: recommendation is advisory only. The final decision is always made by the **APPROVER**.

Evaluation factors include:
- Policy status
- Policy expiry
- Coverage limits
- Supporting documents
- Previous rejected claims
- Repeated diagnosis patterns
- Claim amount validation
- Treatment cost validation

### ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
The analytics dashboard provides administrators with operational and risk insights.

Analytics features include:
- Total claims
- Pending claims
- Approved claims
- Rejected claims
- Settled claims
- Approval rate
- Rejection rate
- Top hospitals
- Top doctors
- High risk users
- Treatment statistics
- Recommendation statistics

### TREATMENT MODULE
The treatment module supports reimbursement claim details and direct treatment capture during claim creation.

## Testing
Testing Strategy:
- User Module tested using JUnit 5 and Mockito.
- Service layer tested using unit tests.
- Database interactions mocked using Mockito.
- Complete workflow testing performed using Postman.
- Authentication, claim workflow, recommendation engine, analytics, and payment processing verified through Postman testing.

Testing details:
- `@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`: enables Mockito support in JUnit 5 tests.
- `@Mock`: creates a mock object for the dependency.
- `@InjectMocks`: injects mock dependencies into the service under test.
- `when(...).thenReturn(...)`: configures mock behavior for repository calls.
- `verify(..., times(...))`: checks that repository methods are called the expected number of times.
- `assertEquals()`: verifies two values are equal.
- `assertTrue()`: verifies a condition is true.
- `assertFalse()`: verifies a condition is false.
- `assertNotNull()`: verifies that an object is not null.

Test file:
- `src/test/java/com/insurance/claimmanagement/service/UserServiceImplTest.java`
- This file contains beginner-friendly examples for service layer unit testing.

Dependencies added for testing:
- `spring-boot-starter-test` (provides JUnit 5, Mockito, and Spring test utilities)
- `mockito-core` (provides Mockito mocking support)

The test suite covers:
- saving a user correctly
- fetching a user by ID
- returning empty when a user is missing
- retrieving all users
- filtering users by role
- updating an existing user
- deleting users correctly
- validating login credentials

Treatment information can include:
- Hospital name
- Hospital address
- Hospital phone
- Doctor name
- Doctor specialization
